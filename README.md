# @kenpb/schematics

Here lies my opinionated schematics for Angular projects, borrowed heavily from [Martin Hocel](https://github.com/Hotell/ng-cli-schematics) own schematics and his [article](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell/use-react-tools-for-better-angular-apps-b0f14f3f8114)

Usage:
```
# For the moment clone and link out the repo somewhere
clone https://github.com/kenpb/schematics
npm link path/to/repo

# Create a new app
ng new -c @kenpb/schematics $app
```
